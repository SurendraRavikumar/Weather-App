# Weather App

This is a simple **Weather App** built using **React.js**. The app allows users to input the name of a city and see the current weather conditions, including:

- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Min Temperature**
- **Max Temperature**
- **How it feels (Feels like)**

The weather data updates dynamically based on the city entered, and the app even changes images based on the temperature and humidity to reflect the weather conditions visually.

## Features

- Search for weather details by city name.
- Displays key weather metrics (Temperature, Humidity, Min Temp, Max Temp, and Feels Like).
- Visual representation of the weather, with images changing according to temperature and humidity levels.
- **Responsive Design** for a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** for building the user interface.
- **CSS** (or styled-components) for styling the app.
- **JavaScript** for logic and interaction.
